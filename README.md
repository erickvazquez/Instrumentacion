# Instrumentacion

Here, you will find some practices made for "Instrumentation" subject. They were made using Pic c comiler for microccontroler (PIC16F877A) programming, Proteus for simulation part, and
in the case of "contador de pulsos", I used C# to make an interface able to connect to serial port and get information from Proteus simulation.
